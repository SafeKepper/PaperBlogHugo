## Chapter 1 - Memory, Biology and my english teacher

if i remember correctly it was 3rd period of that day. I had done something stupid, rather I didn't do my homework and was being questioned by english teacher for an appropriate reason.

which is when i was coined this question for staring at her without 
uttering a word.

> what specimen are you ?

I still wonder about that and this was my first encounter with biology, cause now i needed to know what that word meant.

Memory is kind of a stupid concept you don't remember exactly what lead to things ending up in certain way. it just shows you things that the brain told itself to remember. It's infuriating to accept that i don't have control over this guy called brain who is writing this on his own behalf.

So, That's what i've been chasing after for years through schooling and college internally and externally to have control over it. was there progress? yes and no.

yes, I'm far off answering a question when being asked kudos to me for controlling anxiety as and when needed. it's wierd that this part of me called anxiety, he is afraid of everything that could possibly go right or wrong; existence in itself is a nightmare for him. But, i deal with him, as he is part of me and not me.

The gift of having anxiety as a friend favoured me to getting along with overthinking, now these two guys are close friends. They helped me have a rich inner space, where i can work through all my probabilities. They were the ones made me wonder about biology and the ways computer science took inspiration from biology principles and the hand-on learning was really rewarding, so I started projects with no limit.
